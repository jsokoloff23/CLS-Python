The "Model" part of the CLS program. Holds settings to be used during
CLS Acquisition.

Worth noting that sample_num and region_num refer to the the region_settings_list
index trackers in the CLSController class in Controller.py.

Future Changes:
- Currently uses public attributes but could be changed to a getter/setter design?
  Not sure if encapsulation really matters that much.

- remove_region_settings() method could probably be done in a more beautiful way.

- region_settings class currently contains no methods: could be made into dictionary
  if someone felt inclined.

        First, removes index from region_settings_list. If there exists an element of
        region_settings_list with the same sample_num index as the removed region but a
        higher region_num index, it moves down to replace the removed region. It
        wouldn't make sense for there to be a region 2 without a region 1, for example.

        If the region removed was the only region in the list with its sample_num index
        AND there exists a region at a greater sample_num than the removed region, the
        sample_num index of all the regions with a higher index than the region removed

        sample_num = 1 when there aren't even any regions with sample_num = 0, for example.
